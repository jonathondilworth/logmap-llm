## LogMapLLM
Large Language Models as Oracles for Ontology Alignment with LogMap (work in progress).

There are many methods and systems to tackle the ontology alignment problem, yet a major challenge persists in producing high-quality mappings among a set of input ontologies. Adopting a human-in-the-loop approach during the alignment process has become essential in applications requiring very accurate mappings. However, user involvement is expensive when dealing with large ontologies. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLM) to aid the ontology alignment problem. The use of LLMs is focused only on the validation of a subset of correspondences where an ontology alignment system (e.g., LogMap) is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive analysis over several tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), eveluating the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using different ontology-driven prompt templates. In the [OAEI 2025 Bio-ML track](https://liseda-lab.github.io/OAEI-Bio-ML/2025/index.html#results), LogMap with an LLM-based Oracle has achieved the top-2 overall results. LLM efficacy is also assessed against simulated Oracles with varying error rates.

Current efforts are focusing on the creation of an integrated LogMapLLM pipeline (this repository).

*(Note, this branch contains WiP + experimental code; we plan to isolate each feature and carefully merge back into main)*

### LogMap-LLM conceptual architecture

Here is a conceptual view of LogMap-LLM:

![LogMap-LLM](figs/LogMap-LLM.png "LogMap-LLM conceptual architecture")

The LogMap-LLM pipeline begins with LogMap doing an initial alignment for two ontologies. The references to `M_ask` refer to **mappings to ask** an Oracle. These are mappings (potential or candidate mappings between pairs of ontology entities) of which LogMap is uncertain, and for which it invites feedback (opinions or predictions) from an external Oracle of some kind. In the case of LogMap-LLM, the Oracle is an LLM rather than a human domain expert.  For each candidate mapping (pair of ontology entities) in the set `M_ask`, LogMap-LLM builds a unique Oracle (LLM) **user** prompt to put to an LLM. Different **user** prompt templates can be used that  incorporate different types and amounts of ontological context from the respective ontologies. The predictions of an LLM Oracle in relation to these `M_ask` **user** prompts are collected and fed into LogMap so that it can refine its initial alignment, by taking account of the Oracle's feedback (the predictions of an LLM).

LogMap-LLM currently supports the OpenAI API for interacting with LLMs. This permits LogMap-LLM users to connect with any LLM provider that supports the OpenAI API. The OpenRouter LLM aggregation platform (www.openrouter.ai) supports the OpenAI API. If LogMap-LLM users register an account with OpenRouter, they can reach any of the 500+ LLM models to which OpenRouter provides access --- just by changing a model name in a configuration file.


### LogMap-LLM user experience example 1

The following figure shows a snapshot of a LogMap-LLM session when LogMap-LLM is used from the command-line. In this use case, the hypothetical user is using LogMap-LLM in order to use LogMap by itself, without involving LLM Oracles. This use case best supports exploratory ontology alignment, where the user wants to use LogMap alone, but prefers a Pythonic way of interacting with LogMap (a Java application).

The LogMap-LLM basic configuration file, `logmap-llm-config-basic.toml`, allows the user to configure the LogMap-LLM pipeline (depicted in the conceptual architecture diagram) for the use case demonstrated in this console snapshot.  In `logmap-llm-config-basic.toml`, this pipeline configuration is called **use case A**.

### LogMap-LLM user experience example 2

The following figure shows a snapshot of a LogMap-LLM session when LogMap-LLM is used from the command-line to consult with an LLM Oracle. In this use case, the hypothetical user is reusing an existing intial LogMap alignment, but now is consulting an LLM Oracle for predictions with respect to `M_ask` --- the set of mappings to ask an Oracle.  By taking the feedback from the Oracle with respect to `M_ask` into account, LogMap is able to refine its alignment for the given alignment task.

In the LogMap-LLM basic configuration file, `logmap-llm-config-basic.toml`, the pipeline configuration for this use case is called **use case C**.

### LogMap-LLM user experience example 3

The following figure shows a snapshot of a LogMap-LLM session when LogMap-LLM is used to exercise LogMap's support for **local Oracles** as opposed to **LLM Oracles**. A local Oracle might be a human domain expert, or some external system other than an LLM. Local Oracle predictions with respect to the mappings in `M_ask` are supplied in one or more `.csv` files with a particular structure.

In the LogMap-LLM basic configuration file, `logmap-llm-config-basic.toml`, the pipeline configuration for this use case is called **use case F**.

Note that **use case A** would typically precede **use case F**. One would use **use case A** to get LogMap's mappings to ask an Oracle (`M_ask`). Once the local Oracle predictions for `M_ask` have been prepared (some time later, perhaps hours or days), one would use **use case F** to have LogMap consume the local Oracle predictions in order to refine its initial alignment.
