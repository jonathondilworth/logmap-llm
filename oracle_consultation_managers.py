class OracleConsultationManager_OpenAI:
    '''
    An OracleConsultationManager to manage consultations with an
    Oracle (i.e. interactions with an LLM).

    This OracleConsultationManager uses the OpenAI API to connect
    with LLM endpoints.

    Using this OracleConsultationManager, LogMap-LLM users can
    connect and interact with any LLM provider that supports the
    OpenAI API. This includes OpenAI itself, of course.

    Importantly, the LLM model aggregation platform OpenRouter
    (www.openrouter.ai) supports the OpenAI API. When using
    OpenRouter, LogMap-LLM interacts only with OpenRouter, and
    OpenRouter handles the redirection of LogMap-LLM conversations
    to whichever of 500+ different LLM models the LogMap-LLM user
    selects.

        Consult an Oracle using a particular style or approach.
        
        This function simply delegates a consultation request to the
        appropriate approach-specific consultation function. This level
        of indirection permits LogMap-LLM to explore and support multiple
        different interaction approaches (or styles), as LLM APIs evolve
        and mature over time.

        For example, Open AI has a Chat Completions API and a Responses API.
        And there are multiple ways of using each of the two. The former API
        is stateless; the latter is stateful.

        OpenAI is pushing the Responses API hard, but OpenRouter's support
        for it is currently limited and in Beta status. Crucially, 
        OpenRouter's support for the Responses API is currently 'stateless',
        which means the main feature of the Responses API is unavailable.

        Also, OpenRouter has its own API SDK, but it is in Beta status 
        and subject to breaking changes. One day, when it has matured,
        there may be reason to support it as well.

        --

        JD. Just a quick note on the above. In our case, isn't statelessness
        desirable? We want each oracle decision to be an independent binary
        classification (where we're solely responsible for managing the context
        and chat history), right? There may be some use cases though and the
        design philosophy makes sense!
        
        On the design philosophy point, note that a lot of the code included in
        this snapshot is experimental; so any changes to the original code are
        temporary for the moment. The plan is to clean it up, retain only what is
        neccesary, carefully seperate out each feature and merge them in one by one.
        We can produce clear documentation simultaneously as the process is undertaken.

        --

        (support added for vLLM, but the manner in which this has been accomplished
         cn probably be improved to better align it to the above design philosophy)

        On the first call with style 'auto', discovers whether the endpoint supports 
        parse() (OpenRouter/OpenAI) or needs create() (vLLM/local), then locks in that 
        style for all subsequent calls — no per-request trial and error.

        Parameters
        ----------
        message : str
            A user prompt (aka user message).
        developer_override : str, optional
            If provided, replaces the developer/system message for this
            call only.  Used for entity-type-aware developer prompts
            (e.g. property or instance developer prompts).
        per_query_few_shot : list of (str, str) tuples, optional
            Per-query few-shot examples for hard-similar strategy.
            Each tuple is (user_prompt, assistant_response).  When
            provided, these are injected between the developer message
            and the query for this call only (not part of frozen prefix).
