#
# This module is for defining alternative 'developer' prompts
# to be used in Oracle (LLM) consultations. 
# 
# A 'developer' prompt (or message) conveys instructions to 
# an LLM to set the context for how the LLM should process 
# the one (or more) accompanying 'user' prompts (messages).
# 
# The notions of 'developer' message and 'user' message are
# part of OpenAI's API SDK, which OpenRouter uses as a kind of
# defacto standard for interacting with OpenRouter.
# 
# Currently the content of 'developer' prompts is completely 
# fixed, according to what is written here in this module.
# Support for some sort of templating scheme, to permit
# 'developer' prompts to be customised at the instance level,
# is future work.
#
# Currently, LogMap-LLM uses one user-designated 'developer'
# prompt for all of the Oracle consultations (LLM interactions)
# involved in a given alignment task.

DEV_PROMPT_GENERIC = "You are assisting in an OWL ontology alignment exercise. You will be presented with a pair of entities of the same type (classes, properties or individuals), one entity from each of the two different ontologies. Additional ontological context for each of the two entities may be provided. Some binary relation between the pair of entities will be posited (typically, equivalence or some kind of subsumptive relation). You will be asked to make a binary decision as to whether the posited relation holds (is valid). Adopt the dual personas of ontology alignment expert and domain expert whilst coming to your decision. Give only a one-word binary response regarding the posited relation: true or false."

DEV_PROMPT_CLASS_EQUIVALENCE = "You are assisting in an OWL ontology alignment exercise. You will be presented with a pair of entities representing classes, one class entity from each of the two different ontologies. Additional ontological context for each of the two class entities may be provided. You will be asked to decide whether the two class entities are semantically equivalent. Adopt the dual personas of ontology alignment expert and domain expert whilst coming to your decision. Give only a one-word binary response regarding the posited equivalence relation: true or false."

DEV_PROMPT_BIOMEDICAL = "You are a biomedical ontology expert. Your task is to assess whether two given entities from different biomedical ontologies refer to the same underlying concept. Consider both their semantic meaning and hierarchical context, including parent categories and ontological lineage. Think like a domain expert. Be precise."

DEV_PROMPT_BIOMEDICAL_EQUIV_SYNONYMS = "You are a domain expert assisting in entity alignment across biomedical ontologies. Each entity may include synonyms and category-level relationships. Use synonym information and parent class semantics to decide whether the two entities are semantically equivalent. Be precise."

# JD: the developer prompt registry allows for the above-defined
# (developer/system) prompts to be extended, registered and 
# specified within the config TOML when running logmap-llm.
# Use 'none' to explicitly disable the developer prompt, as
# some do not support this feature.
